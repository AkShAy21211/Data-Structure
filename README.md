# Data-Structure Repository

## Overview
This repository contains implementations and problem sets related to various data structures and algorithms. It is intended as a resource for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving skills in data structures and algorithms.

## Contents
The repository is structured into different categories based on data structures and algorithmic techniques. Each folder contains relevant problems and solutions:

- **Array**: Problems related to arrays, including searching, sorting, and pattern-based questions.
- **Binary Search Tree**: Problems focused on Binary Search Trees (BST) including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Binary & Linear Search**: Implementation and problems on both binary search and linear search algorithms.
- **DFS and BFS**: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) problems for graphs and trees.
- **Graph**: Graph-related problems including traversal, shortest path, and cycle detection.
- **Linked List**: Questions on singly and doubly linked lists, including operations and problem-solving.
- **Numbers**: Mathematical and numerical computation problems.
- **Recursion**: Problems that involve recursive solutions.
- **Sorting**: Various sorting algorithm implementations like merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
- **Stack**: Problems on stack operations, including next greater element and balanced parentheses.
- **Queue**: Queue-related problems including circular queues and priority queues.
- **Hash Table**: Implementation and problem-solving using hash tables.
- **Heap**: Heap-based problems including heap sort and priority queue implementations.
- **Trie**: Problems related to the Trie data structure for efficient string manipulations.
- **Tree**: General tree-based problems including traversal, Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), and diameter of a tree.
